Modifies Lee et al., 2016 Secchi depth algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2016.02.033) by adjusting free parameters

Note: Procedure might push parameters well outside the plausible range for the original parameters that were developed from mechanistic models of the underwater light field.
Please use good judgement when implementing this procedure. Use caution, especially if free parameters are shifted a degree of magnitude.
